CSV Data Formats for Game SimulatorThis document outlines the required CSV formats to load data into the game economy simulator. The system is designed around an item-centric architecture, with a master items.csv file defining all in-game resources.1. Items (items.csv)This file serves as the master definition for all resources available in the game, including currencies and boosters. It is the single source of truth for all items.Formatitem_nameitem_typepriceeffectivenessstringstringintfloatColumn Descriptionsitem_name: The unique string identifier for the item (e.g., "Speedy Time", "coins").item_type: The item's category. Use currency for monetary items and booster for items that provide a gameplay advantage.price: The item's value in the game's base currency. For the base currency itself (e.g., coins), this value should be 1.effectiveness: For items of type booster, this is a float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the percentage of time reduction it provides. For all other item types, this should be 0.0.Example: items.csvitem_name,item_type,price,effectiveness
coins,currency,1,0.0
Speedy Time,booster,50,0.2
Mega Clear,booster,75,0.35
2. Levels (levels.csv)This file defines the properties and rewards for each level in the game.Formatlevel_idbase_durationdifficultyreward_1_namereward_1_amountreward_2_namereward_2_amountintintfloatstringintstringintColumn Descriptionslevel_id: The unique integer ID for the level.base_duration: The expected completion time in seconds for a player of average skill without using any boosters.difficulty: A float between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the level's challenge.reward_[N]_name: The name of the Nth reward granted upon level completion. This name must correspond to an item_name in the items.csv file.reward_[N]_amount: The quantity of the Nth reward to be granted.Example: levels.csvlevel_id,base_duration,difficulty,reward_1_name,reward_1_amount,reward_2_name,reward_2_amount
1,60,0.1,coins,50,,
2,75,0.15,coins,75,Speedy Time,1
3. Players (players.csv)This file defines the different player archetypes for the simulation. The initial inventory for all archetypes is standardized within the simulation script and is not defined in this file.Formatplayer_idskill_potentialbooster_tendencydaily_playtime_budgetstringfloatfloatintColumn Descriptionsplayer_id: A unique string identifier for the player archetype.skill_potential: A float between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the player's innate skill level.booster_tendency: A float between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the player's baseline willingness to use boosters.daily_playtime_budget: The total number of seconds the player archetype is expected to play per day.Example: players.csvplayer_id,skill_potential,booster_tendency,daily_playtime_budget
